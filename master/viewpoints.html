                    Glacier Point, an overlook with a commanding view of Yosemite Valley, Half Dome, Yosemite Falls, and Yosemite’s high country. 
                    This is also a good starting or finishing point for some of Yosemite’s most popular trails, including the Four Mile Trail and the Panorama Trail. 
                    The best time to visit is early spring or fall before the road closes for the season. 
                    In the summer, it can be too popular, especially in the middle of the day.
                    Activities at Glacier Point include: birdwatching, hiking, stargazing and (in the winter months) skiing and snowboarding at Yosemite Ski and Snowboard Area (formerly Badger Pass Ski Area). Be sure to check out Washburn Point just south of Glacier Point.

            The view that Ansel Adams made famous, Tunnel View is a must stop for any first time visit to Yosemite Valley. 
            Find it just outside the Wawona Tunnel on State Highway 41. 
            No hiking is required, you simply park at one of the lots and make your way to the vista. 
            This spot can be very popular in summer, so try to arrive early.
            From this vista you can see El Capitan, Half Dome, and Bridalveil Fall. 
            This vista changes with each season to show something new but the best times to see Tunnel View are early spring (when Bridalveil Fall is at peak flow) and winter, when the beautiful granite domes are draped in snow and mist.

                            Olmsted Point is a famous vista of the northern side of Half Dome, Tenaya Canyon and Tenaya Lake to the east from Tioga Pass off State Highway 120 in Mariposa County.
                            Olmsted Point is a must-do stopping point as you venture over Tioga Pass. 
                            Wander around the so-called “erratic” boulders that are staggered around the granite slopes. 
                            These giant boulders were left when the last glacier came through.

                            In Yosemite Valley, El Capitan Meadow provides a view straight up El Capitan and a great view of Cathedral Rocks, as well. 
                            Located along one-way Northside Drive, it is best to stop here on your way out of Yosemite Valley.

                            Located along one-way Northside Drive, it is best to stop here on your way out of Yosemite Valley. 
                            This popular vista is located just after a view of Bridalveil Fall but immediately before Pohono Bridge, about the time you begin to see directional signs for highways leaving the park.                          <br>

                            What do you do when you hear a waterfall?
                            Most people’s first instinct is to look for the source of the sound, then figure out the best way to get closer to it. 
                            This is certainly true for one of Yosemite Mariposa County’s top attractions: Yosemite Falls, a towering, 2-425-foot set of falls that flow from November to July, seeing peak flows in late spring to early summer. 
                            It’s so magnificent that people literally stop their cars in the middle of the road, get out and start to wander toward the waterfalls on a daily basis in Yosemite National Park.
