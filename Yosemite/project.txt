The theme of my SPARK project is Yosemite National Park.

7 Use Cases for my website:
	1. Obtain information for planning a trip (how much it costs, 
how long it will take to visit each site, etc.)
	2. Find hiking trails (using a map)
	3. Find general information about Yosemite National Parks (what 
qualifies it as a National Park)
	4. Buy merchandise (t-shirts, cups, posters, etc.)
	5. Checking current conditions of the park/trails in the park. 
(forest fires, road closures, weather conditions, etc.)
	6. Read blogs from people who have visited the park
	7. Donate money to the park
