                <h4>Climbing Rules and Regulations</h4>

                <p>There are a number of rules that must be upheld in order to climb safely in Yosemite National Park. <br> They are summarized in this section.  For the full list of rules and regulations, click <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/climbing_regulations.htm">here</a>.</p>

                <ol>
                        <li><strong>Fixed Ropes</strong></li>
                                <ul>
                                        <li style='color: white;'>
                                                        Property left unattended in Yosemite for longer than 24 hours is considered abandoned and may be impounded.
                                        </li>
                                </ul>
                        <li><strong>Human Waste and Trash</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Boldering</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Slacklining</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Bolting Policy and New Routes</strong></li>
                
                </ol>
                <p>   However, the National Park Service recognizes that there are circumstances when it is impractical for climbers to return to fixed ropes within 24 hours. In such cases we ask that you leave ropes and equipment in place only as long as you are actively using the lines.
                Fixing ropes to get a head start: if you decide to fix ropes partway up a route before beginning your ascent, do so only immediately before beginning your climb and remove them once you commit to the route.
                Fixing ropes to “work” a route: If you plan to return to a route regularly, leave your ropes in place only when you are actively working the route. (This does not include taking a week off to rest.)
                Established fixed ropes: Ropes like those sometimes found below Heart Ledges on El Capitan are not maintained or condoned by the National Park Service.
                Mini Traxion Lines: Same rules apply; If you fix a line for training, remove it the same day. As a courtesy, do not leave ropes or gear on popular routes that might be an eyesore or an inconvenience to other climbers.</p>
